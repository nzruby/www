    <h1>Strategic Vision</h1>

    <p>This is a strategic vision for Ruby NZ for 2019-2020. We will use this as a guide for the actions we take. </p>

    <p>Our charter specifies the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Foster and support the Ruby programming language, its users, community and ecosystem in New Zealand;</li>
    <li>Advocate for Open Source in general, and the Ruby programming language in particular.</li>
    <li>Provide support for Ruby community events.</li>
    <li>Work with event organisers to ensure the Ruby community and events in New Zealand are safe and welcoming.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is where we want Ruby NZ to be in 2020.</p>

      <li>We have good partnerships with organisations that teach and use Ruby.</li>
    </ul>
