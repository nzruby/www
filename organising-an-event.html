Title: Organising an Event
layout: default

<h1>Organising an event with Ruby NZ</h1>
<p>We're really happy to underwrite community events like meetups, Rails Girls, Rails Bridge, Rails Camp, Ruby Retreat, Kiwi Ruby, or whatever brilliant new idea you have. These events are all independently organised, but go through our bank accounts.</p>
<p>Ruby NZ generally expects to absorb any profit or loss, but maintains separate balances for some recurring events. If we pay for items like electronics, we would expect for those to be added to the society's asset register, and to be available for other events (even if you physically keep hold of them).</p>
<p>Anyone can run a Ruby NZ event! If you want to organise an event through Ruby NZ, or get Ruby NZ support for an existing event, please write a proposal to be approved by the committee. Email it through to <a href="mailto:committee@ruby.nz">committee@ruby.nz</a> or send it to <a href="/#current-committee">one of us on Slack</a>, and we'll discuss it at our next meeting.</p>
<p>
  Event organisers should familiarise themselves with the committee's
  <a href="/events/alcohol-advice.html">advice on NZ legislation</a>.
</p>
<p>Here are some of the things we'd like to know about in a proposal for an event:</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>What kind of event do you want to run? Is it a one-off or something recurring? Why will it be great? Have you run it before? When do you think it'll be? Who's it aimed at? Do you need any extra support from Ruby NZ, or do you just want to run it through our bank accounts?</p>

<h3>Team</h3>
<p>We want to know about your team! Who do you have involved with this? Have you done this kind of thing before?</p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>You should put together a proposal with an outline of costs that you expect to have and income that you expect to have. We expect you to try your best to keep the event in the green, but we understand that things don't always go as planned.</p>

<p>You might like to keep delightful but unnecessary 'nice-to-haves' like coffee carts, T-shirts, or wheels of cheese out of the budget at this stage, and seek sponsorship for those items specifically.</p>

<p><strong>For example, for a Ruby Retreat or Rails Camp:</strong></p>

<h4>Income:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ticket sales</li>
  <li>Sponsorship</li>
</ul>

<h4>Costs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Venue</li>
  <li>Transport</li>
  <li>Catering</li>
  <li>Printing</li>
  <li>Catering</li>
  <li>Drinks</li>
  <li>Stationery</li>
  <li>T-shirts</li>
  <li>Transport for organisers when seeking venues</li>
  <li>Food for organiser meetups</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For a free event like a Rails Girls or Rails Bridge:</strong></p>

<h4>Income:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sponsorship</li>
</ul>

<h4>Costs:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Catering</li>
  <li>Venue (if not sponsored)</li>
  <li>Swag</li>
  <li>T-shirts</li>
  <li>Printing</li>
  <li>Lanyards</li>
  <li>Food for organiser meetups</li>
</ul>

<p>You don't need to be too detailed about the exact amount of these, but it would be good to know that you've thought about them or found quotes.</p>

<p>If unexpected costs come up, the treasurer can approve small costs, or might raise them to the committee if they're unsure. Costs over $500 will need to be approved by the committee, which may not happen until their monthly meeting - so try to look ahead and keep in touch with previous event organisers who have a good idea of what's likely to come up.</p>

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>If you haven't organised this event before, we would like you to think about the possible risks, how likely they are, and how serious they are. If they're fairly likely or very serious, we'd like you to tell us what you'll do to mitigate those risks.</p>

<h4>For example:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Not enough sponsorship</li>
  <li>Not selling enough tickets</li>
  <li>Venue costs higher than expected</li>
  <li>One of the key organisers gets sick</li>
  <li>Harassment during the event</li>
</ul>

<p>If there's anything unclear or if you'd just like to chat it over before putting together a proposal, send us an email at <a href="mailto:committee@ruby.nz">committee@ruby.nz</a> or get in touch with <a href="/#current-committee">one of us on Slack</a> - we're keen to hear from you!</p>
